# Custom Password Generator
 
## Description
Security experts suggest using unique password for each of your accounts. This random password generator app creates a random custom passweord that includes some or all of the following:

- UPPERCASE LETTERS
- lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special Characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) - _ +

## User friendly Features
- Validates the character count input to keep the range from 8 to 128. The app rounds the input to the nearest available option instead of popping an error message and stopping their progress. 
- If the user declines the first three format options (lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers), then the app will autoselect the UPPERCASE option to keep the user moving forward.
- Updated font and wrote an app introduction on index.html.
- Updated the placeholder text to provide user guidiance.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
